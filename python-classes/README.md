# Python - Classes and Objects
## At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to `explain to anyone`, without the help of Google:<br/>
* What is OOP <br/>
* “first-class everything” <br/>
* What is a class <br/>
* What is an object and an instance <br/>
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance <br/>
* What is an attribute <br/>
* What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes <br/>
* What is self <br/>
* What is a method <br/>
* What is the special __init__ method and how to use it <br/>
* What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding <br/>
* What is a property <br/>
* What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python <br/>
* What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python <br/>
* How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class <br/>
* How to bind attributes to object and classes <br/>
* What is the __dict__ of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain <br/>
* How does Python find the attributes of an object or class <br/>
* How to use the getattr function <br/>

# Requirements <br/>
## Python Scripts <br/>
* Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs` <br/>
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5) <br/>
* All your files should end with a new line <br/>
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3 <br/>
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory <br/>
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*) <br/>
* All your files must be executable <br/>
* The length of your files will be tested using wc <br/>
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)') <br/>
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)') <br/>
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c <br/>
* 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)') <br/>
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified) <br/>
